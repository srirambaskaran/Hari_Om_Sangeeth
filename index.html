					<header>What is Lorem Ipsum?</header>
					<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
						typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
						dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
						galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
						has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
						electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
						popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
						containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
						publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
						Lorem Ipsum.</p>
						<header>Where does it come from?</header>
					<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
						text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
						45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
						professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
						the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
						passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
						literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
						from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
						Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
						BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
						during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
						ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
